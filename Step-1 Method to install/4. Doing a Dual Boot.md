# Dual-Booting Windows with Linux Mint

In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of dual-booting Windows with Linux Mint. Dual-booting allows you to have both Windows and Linux Mint on the same computer, giving you the flexibility to choose your operating system at startup.

## **Step 1: Prepare Your System**

1. Before you start, it's essential to back up all your important data. Dual-booting involves making changes to your system, and data loss can occur if not done carefully.

2. Create a bootable USB drive with the Linux Mint installation media. You can use tools like Rufus or Balena Etcher for this purpose.

## **Step 2: Install Linux Mint**

1. Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer and restart it.

2. During startup, access the boot menu or BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing a key like F2, F12, or Del) and set your computer to boot from the USB drive.

3. Follow the Linux Mint installation wizard:
   - Select your language and keyboard layout.
   - Choose "Install Linux Mint alongside Windows."
   - Select the amount of disk space you want to allocate to Linux Mint. The installer will create a new partition for Linux.
   - Set your time zone and create a user account.

4. Continue with the installation process, and Linux Mint will be installed alongside Windows.

## **Step 3: Boot into Linux Mint**

1. After the installation is complete, remove the USB drive and restart your computer.

2. You will now see a boot menu that allows you to choose between Windows and Linux Mint. Use the arrow keys to select Linux Mint and press Enter.

3. You're now in Linux Mint, and you can start using it as your second operating system.

## **Step 4: Access Both Windows and Linux Mint**

1. Whenever you start your computer, the boot menu will appear, giving you the option to choose between Windows and Linux Mint.

2. Select your desired operating system to boot into.

**Note:** Dual-booting can sometimes be challenging, and issues may arise. It's essential to follow the process carefully and be prepared to troubleshoot if necessary. You can find help on online forums and communities if you encounter any problems.
