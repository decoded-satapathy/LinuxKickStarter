# Complete Clean Installation of Linux Mint

**Warning:** This process involves wiping Windows from your system, and all data on your Windows installation will be lost. Make sure to back up any essential data before proceeding.

In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of performing a complete clean installation of Linux Mint on your computer. This will replace your existing Windows installation with Linux Mint.

## **Step 1: Prepare Your System**

1. Before you begin, back up all important data from your Windows installation. This process will erase all data on your Windows partition.

2. Create a bootable USB drive with the Linux Mint installation media. You can use tools like Rufus or Balena Etcher for this purpose.

## **Step 2: Install Linux Mint**

1. Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer and restart it.

2. During startup, access the boot menu or BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing a key like F2, F12, or Del) and set your computer to boot from the USB drive.

3. Follow the Linux Mint installation wizard:
   - Select your language and keyboard layout.
   - Choose "Erase disk and install Linux Mint."
   - Confirm the changes when prompted.

4. Continue with the installation process. Linux Mint will be installed on the entire disk, wiping the Windows installation.

## **Step 3: Complete the Installation**

1. Once the installation is complete, remove the USB drive and restart your computer.

2. Linux Mint will boot up as your primary operating system.

**Warning:** Make sure you have backed up all essential data from your Windows installation because it will be permanently erased during this process.

## **Step 4: Access and Use Linux Mint**

1. You now have a clean installation of Linux Mint, and you can start using it for your computing needs.

**Note:** A clean installation wipes the entire hard drive, removing Windows and all associated data. Ensure you're confident in your decision before proceeding.
