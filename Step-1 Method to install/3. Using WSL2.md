# Using WSL 2 on Windows 11

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of installing Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) on a Windows 11 system. WSL 2 allows you to run a full Linux kernel alongside your Windows installation.

## Step 1: Enable WSL Feature

1. Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges. You can do this by searching for "PowerShell" in the Windows search bar, right-clicking on "Windows PowerShell," and selecting "Run as administrator."

2. Run the following command to enable the WSL feature:
   ```powershell
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

3. Wait for the process to complete, and you'll be prompted to restart your computer. Type 'Y' and press Enter to confirm the restart.

## Step 2: Install a Linux Distribution

1. After your computer restarts, open the Microsoft Store and search for your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, or Fedora).
2. Select the Linux distribution you want to install and click "Get." This will download the Linux distribution to your system.
3. Once the installation is complete, click "Launch" to initialize and configure your Linux distribution.
4. You'll be prompted to create a user and set a password during the first launch.

## Step 3: Set WSL 2 as Default

1. Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges.
2. Run the following command to set WSL 2 as the default version for all Linux distributions you install:

	```wsl --set-default-version 2```


## **Step 4: Using WSL 2**

You've now successfully installed and set up WSL 2 on your Windows 11 system. You can run Linux commands and applications from your Windows command prompt.
